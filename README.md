# Data visualization with R
### Data visualization with ggplot2
Hi everyone and season's greetings. Last week I published a post on ["Data visualization with tableau"] (https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/data-visualization-tableau-shabnam-abghari?trk=mp-author-card) and I thought it might be worthwhile to replicate the same attempt using ggplot2 package in R and observe the differences if there are any. It was a fun exercise and I'd like to share the results with you.

I am working with "Crime Incidents" data-set hosted at [OpenDataPhilly] (https://www.opendataphilly.org/dataset/crime-incidents), which lists all Philadelphia crime incidents between 2006 and 2016 recorded by Philadelphia Police Department.

You can find the analysis that I have run on crime data [here] (https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/power-data-visualization-shabnam-abghari?trk=mp-author-card).
