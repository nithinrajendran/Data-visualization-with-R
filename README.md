# Data visualization with ggplot2

Hi everyone and season's greetings. My previous repository had vizualizations done with Tableau and I thought it might be worthwhile to replicate the same attempt using ggplot2 package in R and observe the differences if there are any. It was a fun exercise and I'd like to share the results with you.

I am working with "Crime Incidents" data-set hosted at [OpenDataPhilly] (https://www.opendataphilly.org/dataset/crime-incidents), which lists all Philadelphia crime incidents between 2006 and 2016 recorded by Philadelphia Police Department.
