# Data visualization with R
### Data visualization with ggplot2
I thought it might be worthwhile to replicate what I did in Tableau using ggplot2 package in R and observe the differences if there are any. It was a fun exercise and I'd like to share the results with you.

I am working with "Crime Incidents" data-set hosted at [OpenDataPhilly] (https://www.opendataphilly.org/dataset/crime-incidents), which lists all Philadelphia crime incidents between 2006 and 2016 recorded by Philadelphia Police Department.
